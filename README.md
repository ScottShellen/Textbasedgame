Text Based Adventure Game
------------------------------------

- Class based attributes and methods with ability to have limited actions with NPC
- The game only lasts about a minute

  This game is my first project in the codecademy course for computer science. It took me a lot longer than I wanted it too, but its a near finished to finished project. ChatGPT was used for a few sections of the code I got stuck on. And there are without a doubt improvements that can be done with the project. Such as the immplementation of sub and super classes.
